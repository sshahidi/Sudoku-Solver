=============

This is Sudoku solver program written in C++. The input and output are CSV files. It can solve Sudoku with different sizes: 4x4, 9x9 (default), 16x16 (for sudoku experts!).
 
 You are free to take this code, edit it, and use if for whatever reason you like, with your own reponsiblity.
 You can contact me if you have suggestions to upgrade this code to the next level!
 
 What's in the code:
 Currently, there only exists a single source file, consisting of a solver class and a sample main function.
 The solver mainly has a solvePuzzle() function that solves the sudoku.
 The solver can read/write CSV files, given the correct size of the Sudoku.

 I would like to add an extra part to this code that can generate random sudokus with their answers, so that people can play the sudoku.
